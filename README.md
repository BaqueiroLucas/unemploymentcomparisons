# unemploymentcomparisons
A portfolio about unemployment comparisons between cities, regions/states and the country.

The first notebook added was about Ann Arbor, Michigan; the State of Michigan; and the United States itself, considering the timelapse between Jan. 2020 and Apr. 2021 (the data available during the COVID-19 pandemic on all regions).
